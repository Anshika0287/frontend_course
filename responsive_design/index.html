How Browser tells, "how the page will look like" in other device size? or How narrow screen devices renders webpage?
Browser first renders on virtual view port, it is wider than target device and shrinks this page to a point it fits desired size. 

Why broswer does this?
Many pages are not mobile optimized and breaks when rendered at small width.
Browser attempt to make non mobile optimized website look better on mobile devices.

Is this always successful?
